# Google Business Scraper

This tool allows you to scrape business-related data from Google Places using the Google Places API. It collects details such as business name, location, rating, contact information, and industry. The data is then cleaned and saved as a CSV file for further analysis.

## Requirements

Before running the scraper, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `requests`
- `pandas`

You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests pandas
